Open the DNASP software, load the data as described in the **AMOVA with Alerquin** instructions. Next, navigate to the `Analysis` tab and select `Tajima's test`.

Then calculate the indices for the two populations.

Finally, please organize the results as follows:

For Group 1, a positive Tajima's D suggests a potential excess of rare polymorphisms, possibly indicating population expansion or recent positive selection. A p-value greater than 0.1 suggests no significant evidence against a neutral evolutionary model, indicating no strong support for significant mutation in this population.

In contrast, for Group 2, a negative Tajima's D might indicate recent population expansion or positive selection. Similarly, a p-value greater than 0.1 suggests no significant evidence against a neutral evolutionary model, implying no strong evidence of significant mutation in this population either.
