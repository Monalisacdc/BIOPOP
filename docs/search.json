Download link: https://github.com/AdamBessa/Fasta2Structure/tree/main/Fasta2Structure_W\nCopy the entire sequence, paste it into a text editor like Notepad, and save it with the extension .str.\nNow that the input file is ready, let’s download Structure. Download from the link: https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure_software/release_versions/v2.3.4/html/structure.html\nOpen the Software, click on File, and select New project\n1º Define the project name , directory, and select the dataset to be use.\n2º Specify the number of individuals; in this example, I’ve entered 59 because I have 59 isolates. Ploidy is 1 because it’s haploid, and there are 247 loci. How do I define this? When I performed AMOVA in R, it displayed the number of individuals and loci. The missing datas are represented by -9 because in fasta2structure, missing data is coded as -9.\n3º The selection of what to mark depends on how you have organized your data. In my case, I do not have any additional information to provide, so I did not mark anything.\n4º I marked the individual ID because, as seen in the data input, each ID is followed by its corresponding sequence. If there is a value preceding the sequence that indicates subpopulation information, select it if there is information available on putative population.\nAfter that, click on Parameter set &gt; New\nThere are two issues to worry about: (1) burnin length: how long to run the simulation before collecting data to minimize the effect of the starting configuration, and (2) how long to run the simulation after the burnin to get accurate parameter estimates.\nNext, define the length of the burning period, which is the initial phase of the simulation where results are not yet stable and do not reflect the desired distribution. The chosen value indicates how many of these initial iterations will be discarded. Typically, at least 10,000 are chosen. In practice your run length may be determined by your computer speed and patience as much as anything else. If you are dealing with extremely large data sets and are frustrated with the run times, you might try trimming both the length of the runs, and the number of markers/individuals, at least for exploratory analyses.\nThe choices for the next sessions depend on the researcher’s objectives. In this example, I am selecting the admixture model because I want to analyze genetic admixture. Correlated allele frequencies have also been chosen because a single species is being analyzed, thus it is expected that their allele frequencies are correlated.\nAfter that, click OK and assign a name to the project as prompted. Then, click on Project at the top of the software, followed by Start a job . The window below will open.\nSelect the project you just named, then set the number of K. I chose from 1 to 10; if the maximum K number is obtained in my results, I will test again from 1 to 15… Ensure the number of iterations is at least 20. It will simulate 20 times for K=1, then K=2…\nThen click Start and wait for the analysis to run. Once it finishes, the results will be saved in a folder named results. You should zip this folder by right-clicking on it and selecting that option.\nTo better identify K, you should use the Structure Selector website to determine the best K based on Delta K. Click on this link to access the site https://lmme.ac.cn/StructureSelector/\nTo verify the concordance of the 20 iterations, you can use the Clum Park server website. https://clumpak.tau.ac.il/results.html?jobId=1718562862"

You can download it at: http://www.ub.edu/dnasp/\nLearn how to define groups and set up sequence formats in Genetic Structure &gt; AMOVA in Arlequin. The detailed explanation has been provided earlier; here, we focus solely on obtaining the values and interpreting them. Ensure you use aligned data and follow the steps to define the desired groups and data formats.\n1°Click on Analysis, and then on Gene flow and genetic differentiation\n\n\n\n\n\n2° Then a new window will open. Before clicking OK, define the formats you wish to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n3°Obtaining and interpreting the results.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation: The analysis of gene flow between two populations, based on haplotypes, DNA sequences, and nucleotide substitutions, revealed high genetic homogeneity and very high gene flow. Genetic differentiation measures (DeltaSt, GammaSt, Gst, Nst, and Fst) indicate little to no differentiation, with extremely high values of Nm suggesting significant genetic exchange between populations, keeping them genetically indistinguishable.\nDue to the high migration rate, genetic differentiation caused by random genetic drift is avoided, as individuals freely circulate between populations.\n\n\nWhich model best explains migration?\nFor this study, we will use the software Migrate-n. Click to download: https://peterbeerli.com/migrate/\nFirst, we need to convert the file for Migrate-n. Use PGDSpider for this purpose. After conversion, you’ll notice the file is in TXT format. Open the file in a text editor, go to “Save As,” change the file extension from .txt to .seq, and ensure the file is organized correctly. Here’s an example of an input for Migrate-n:\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore listing the first individual of the second population in your input, ensure there’s information about the population’s name and the number of individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve completed these steps, open the Migrate-n program. The program’s initial screen will appear as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nType D and press Enter. This will open the following screen where you can define, for example, the model you wish to use. Simply enter 1 to select the model. To return to the main screen, type y.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s set up our input and name the output file. Since we’re starting with the full matrix model, name it ‘full_matrix’. Here’s how: type 'I' and press Enter to enter the following screen. Then, type '1' and Enter to specify the input name, enter your input file’s name, and press Enter. Use 'Y' to return, then type '7' and Enter to set the output name, enter your desired output file name, and press Enter. Finally, type ‘Y’ and Enter twice to return to the initial screen.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the initial screen, type P to set the parameters, then enter 5 to define the model.\nImportant: I’ll guide you through setting up each model or hypothesis I’ve decided to test. Remember, earlier we named the output “Full matrix.” When adding each model, I’ll append it to “Full matrix ****.” Then, I’ll return to the main screen to configure the remaining settings specific to that model. For instance, in ‘S,’ you’ll set parameters like the number of Markov chains and other details as needed. I’ll provide a reference article and video on this webpage. After setting up, I’ll run the Full matrix model and wait until the “finished” message appears. A PDF file named Full matrix will be generated in the program’s folder. I’ll repeat this process for model 1, naming the output model 1 and configuring it accordingly. After running and receiving the “finished” message, I’ll proceed similarly for subsequent models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce completed, you’ll obtain three PDFs, each corresponding to a different model. Copy the BTI value from each PDF as indicated in the table below, and paste it into your R code. Next, we’ll determine which model best explains gene flow using R software.\n\n\n\nChoosing the best model\nFirst, you’ll need to install the devtools package, and then download mtraceR from GitHub.\n\n#install.packages(\"devtools\")\n#library(devtools)\n#install_github(\"carlopacioni/mtraceR\")\n\nThe values enclosed in parentheses represent the BTI values for Full matrix, Model 1, and Model 2, respectively.\n\nlibrary(mtraceR)\nmod.comp &lt;- BF(c(-3383.03, -3363.48, -3364.00))\nmod.comp\n\n       lmL    LBF mod.rank mod.prob\n1 -3383.03 -39.10        3    0.000\n2 -3363.48   0.00        1    0.739\n3 -3364.00  -1.04        2    0.261\n\n\nBased on likelihood values, Bayes factors, and probabilities, Model 1 (Group 1 → Group 2) best fits the data. This suggests that migration from Group 1 to Group 2 is the most likely direction. Model 2, where Group 2 influences Group 1, is less probable but still plausible. Model 3, suggesting bidirectional flow, receives very weak support from the data."

The Shannon-Wiener (H’) and Stoddart-Taylor (G) diversity indices are quite similar across the groups, suggesting a balanced distribution of MLGs. However, Group 2 stands out with a notably higher level of genetic diversity, as indicated by a greater G value.\nMoreover, the lambda index, which represents the probability that two randomly chosen genotypes will be different, is slightly higher in Group 2 (0.875) compared to Group 1 (0.850). This reinforces the observation that Group 2 has higher genetic diversity, reflecting greater heterogeneity in the genotypic composition of its populations.\nSince the sample sizes used to calculate these diversity measures differ, direct comparison is not appropriate. Therefore, I will compute the Simpson’s index, which is obtained by subtracting the sum of squared genotype frequencies from one. This index estimates the probability that two randomly selected genotypes will be different, ranging from 0 (indicating no genotype differences) to 1 (indicating maximum genotype diversity).👇\n\nN      &lt;- diversity$N      \nlambda &lt;- diversity$lambda \n(N/(N - 1)) * lambda      \n\n[1] 0.8831909 0.9032258 0.8936295\n\n\nWhen calculating the adjusted Simpson’s index, which reflects the probability of two genotypes being different, both groups showed high values (0.88 for Group 1 and 0.90 for Group 2), indicating high genetic diversity in both populations. Therefore, while Group 2 exhibits slightly higher diversity compared to Group 1, both demonstrate substantial levels of genetic diversity. This suggests a high likelihood of randomly sampling different genotypes from the same subpopulation\n\n\n\nmlg.table(usflu.genind)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       MLG.1 MLG.2 MLG.3 MLG.4 MLG.5 MLG.6 MLG.7 MLG.8 MLG.9 MLG.10 MLG.11\nGrupo1     0     1     1     0     0     1     0     1     2      9      1\nGrupo2     1     0     0     1     3     0     1     0     2      9      1\n       MLG.12 MLG.13 MLG.14 MLG.15 MLG.16 MLG.17 MLG.18 MLG.19 MLG.20 MLG.21\nGrupo1      0      0      1      0      0      0      0      1      1      3\nGrupo2      1      2      0      1      1      1      1      0      0      1\n       MLG.22 MLG.23 MLG.24 MLG.25 MLG.26\nGrupo1      2      0      1      1      1\nGrupo2      2      4      0      0      0\n\n\nThe E.5 evenness index revealed a uniform distribution of genotypic abundances in both populations, with values close to 0.65.

If the file is currently in plain text format, you’ll need to convert it by saving it as a .fst file.\nDownloading MEGA Software: To perform sequence alignment, we’ll need to use the MEGA software. Please follow the link below to access and download it: https://www.megasoftware.net/home\n\n\n\n\nLET’S GET STARTED!\n\nOpening the MEGA Program: Open the MEGA program. Click on File &gt; Open A File/Session, then select your FASTA file containing the sequences you wish to align. A dialog box will appear asking what you want to do. Choose Align .\nReviewing Sequence Information: Afterwards, you can review the information about your sequences. For example, under Data, you can click on Genetic Code to select the appropriate genetic code, or leave it as standard. You can also specify whether you are working with DNA or protein sequences.\nChecking for Missing Isolates: You should also check if there are any isolates without sequences. If true, right-click on the isolate and delete it (see figure below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring Reverse Complement Option: In the image above, we can also observe the option to reverse complement.When performing alignment and encountering an isolate that is markedly different, it is useful to reverse the isolate to check if the alignment improves. Sometimes, the sequence may be in reverse orientation. Verify if it aligns with the others; if not, you can undo the reverse using Ctrl+Z.\nPerforming Alignment: After that, select all sequences using the command Ctrl+A. Then, click on Alignment at the top of the window and choose the type of alignment: either by Muscle or by Clustal W. A new window will open where you can choose the number of iterations and the clustering model you wish to use (see figure below). Click OK, and the alignment will be ready.\n\nObs: The choice between MUSCLE and ClustalW may vary depending on specific project needs, such as dataset size, desired accuracy, and user familiarity with each program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the alignment\nClick on Data, then select Export Alignment and choose the desired format.

AMOVA creates a matrix of genetic distances among all individuals in a sample based on allele sharing or differences in nucleotide sequences. It is a method used to estimate the fixation index (FST), which is the probability that any two randomly sampled alleles in a population are identical by descent (Milgroom, 2015).\nDetailed explanations can be found in Michael G. Milgroom’s book “Population Biology of Plant Pathogens,” Chapter 6, pages 123-128.\n\n\n\n\nHere, I’ll explain two methods for calculating AMOVA. First, using the software Arlequin, and then using R."

The sequences for each haplotype are contained in the .hap file. In Repeat for the others groups. Essentially, copy the header definitions for each group in the file.arp and then paste the sequence next to the haplotype that is in the FILE.hap file. Finally, add the following information at the end of this new file:\n[[Structure]] StructureName=“Phylogeography”\nNbGroups=1\nIndividualLevel = 0\nGroup= { “vicosa” “concordia” }\nNote that there is 1 group containing two subdivisions. In this case, the aim is to assess Viçosa with Concordia.

However, it does not provide quantitative information on the extent of migration. Therefore, I proceed with another analysis to assess the exact degree of migration."

    "text": "Linkage disequilibrium, also referred to as gametic disequilibrium, is commonly defined and modeled for haplotypes or populations of haploid gametes. LD estimation involves comparing observed haplotype frequencies from two or more loci with those expected under the null hypothesis of random mating. Expected frequencies are calculated assuming independence (no selection, mutation, etc.). This assumption holds that alleles at unlinked loci are independent if populations mate randomly, segregating independently during meiosis, where D=0 (Milgroom, 2015)3,.\nThis analysis should be conducted using R Studio software.\nLoad libraries\n\nlibrary(vcfR)\nlibrary(poppr)\nlibrary(ape)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\nLoad data and transform\n\nusflu.dna2 &lt;- fasta2DNAbin(file = 'alinhamentocerto.fas')\nisolate_name &lt;- as.character(rownames(usflu.dna2))\ngrupos &lt;- ifelse(startsWith(isolate_name, \"UFV\"), \"Grupo1\", \"Grupo2\")\nusflu.genind &lt;- DNAbin2genind(x = usflu.dna2, pop = grupos)\nusflu.genind\n\n\nlibrary(\"magrittr\")\n\n######group1##############3\ngrup1 &lt;- popsub(usflu.genind, \"Grupo1\")\nia(grup1, sample = 999)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ia       p.Ia      rbarD       p.rD \n28.7768532  0.0010000  0.2301385  0.0010000 \n\n  grup1 %&gt;% clonecorrect() %&gt;% ia(sample = 999)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Ia      p.Ia     rbarD      p.rD \n17.360780  0.001000  0.133661  0.001000 \n\n################Group 2 #############\n\n\ngp2 &lt;- popsub(usflu.genind, \"Grupo2\")\nia(gp2, sample = 999)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ia       p.Ia      rbarD       p.rD \n48.0019088  0.0010000  0.2342778  0.0010000 \n\ngp2 %&gt;% clonecorrect() %&gt;% ia(sample = 999)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ia       p.Ia      rbarD       p.rD \n51.4605232  0.0010000  0.2355035  0.0010000 \n\n\nH0: There is no linkage between the loci.\nFor Group 1, comprising 27 individuals, we observed a linkage disequilibrium (LD) of 0.23 with a p-value of 0.001, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis of no linkage. Similarly, in Group 2, which includes 32 individuals, we found an LD of 0.234 with p=0.001, also rejecting the null hypothesis. Even after adjusting the data to account for clonality, the results remain consistent, albeit with different LD values. The graphical representation confirmed these findings, depicting distributions that deviate significantly from those expected under no linkage. Thus, we conclude that both populations are clonal."
