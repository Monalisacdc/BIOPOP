A dialog box will open where you'll see a list titled \"List of all sequence,\" containing all individuals.

Additionally, it will be saved in a .**arp** file containing information about each group (number of haplotypes and which haplotypes are present in each group). From these two generated files, another document will be manually created in .arp format, consolidating the information from both groups.\n\n## How to manually assemble this file for input into Arlequin?\n\nIn this example, only two groups were created, so the input is based on that. This step is crucial, so **pay close attention** to how you assemble the input.\n\n![](dnasp4.jpg)\n\nIn the figure, I'm showing only for group 1, which I named \"Viçosa.\" However, if you continue scrolling through the .arp file, you will find headers for the other groups. The sequences for each haplotype are contained in the .hap file. In Repeat for the others groups. Essentially, copy the header definitions for each group in the file.arp and then paste the sequence next to the haplotype that is in the FILE.hap file. Finally, add the following information at the end of this new file:\n\n\\[\\[Structure\\]\\] StructureName=\"Phylogeography\"\n\nNbGroups=1\n\nIndividualLevel = 0\n\nGroup= { \"vicosa\" \"concordia\" }\n\nNote that there is 1 group containing two subdivisions. In this case, the aim is to assess Viçosa with Concordia. Now, if you had, for example, three subgroups—Viçosa, Concordia, and Uberlândia—and your goal was to evaluate Concordia with Viçosa first, and then separately Concordia with Uberlândia, you would have 2 main groups and 3 subgroups in total.\n\n## Your input is ready. \n\n# Let's analyze it using the Arlequin software\n\nFirst, you need to download the Arlequin software.
